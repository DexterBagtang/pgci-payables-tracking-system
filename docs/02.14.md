q1: Yes po/invoices have PHP and USD currencies
q2: Im not sure but majority is PHP currency but i guess its 75/25 percentage php/usd
q3: just need to see them separately

2: all of them just really need to display the currency 
3: i like the option B
4: we should add usd_amount too especially when invoices are usd
5: no we keep them separate

Critical Desicions:
1. A
2. B but make sure only same currency of invoices should be grouped in the check requisition 
3. its up to you
4. Yes

1. im just concerned on the percentage bar that seems not working when both usd and php exist
2. yes
3. find a way to display the usd and php separately which is already there but the percentage bar is not working well

## Multi-Currency Accuracy Fix - IMPLEMENTED (2026-02-14)

### Problem
The project details page had critical accuracy issues when mixing PHP and USD currencies:
- Budget utilization incorrectly added USD amounts to PHP amounts (treating $1 as ₱1)
- All percentage calculations were mathematically invalid
- Progress bars showed inaccurate metrics

### Solution Implemented
**Currency-Separated Metrics** - No combined calculations, separate PHP and USD sections

### Changes Made

#### Frontend (`resources/js/pages/projects/components/ProjectShow.jsx`)
1. **Financial Calculations** (lines 63-242)
   - Removed mixed-currency totals (`totalPOAmount`, `totalInvoicedAmount`, etc.)
   - Added PHP-only budget calculations (`remainingBudgetPHP`, `budgetUtilizationPHP`)
   - Separated invoice progress (`invoicedProgressPHP`, `invoicedProgressUSD`)
   - Separated payment progress (`paymentProgressPHP`, `paymentProgressUSD`)

2. **UI Components Updated**
   - **PO Committed Card**: Now shows PHP percentage of budget only
   - **Total Invoiced Card**: Displays separate PHP/USD progress bars
   - **Total Paid Card**: Shows separate PHP/USD payment progress
   - **Budget Summary Card**: PHP budget with utilization + separate USD PO tracking
   - **Payment Summary Card**: Separate PHP and USD sections with individual progress
   - **Vendor Summary**: Currency-separated amounts and progress bars

#### Backend (`app/Models/Project.php`)
3. **Budget Utilization Attribute** (lines 82-98)
   - Separated PHP and USD commitments
   - Returns `committed_php`, `committed_usd`, `remaining_php`, `percentage_php`
   - Added `has_usd` flag to indicate USD PO existence

### Results
✅ **Mathematically accurate** - No mixing of currencies
✅ **Clear to users** - Explicit PHP vs USD separation
✅ **No external dependencies** - No exchange rate APIs needed
✅ **Future-proof** - Easy to add more currencies

### Example Display
- **PHP Budget**: ₱1,000,000 budget, ₱600,000 committed (60% utilization)
- **USD POs**: $10,000 committed (tracked separately, no budget comparison)
- **Invoiced Progress**: PHP 66.7%, USD 80% (separate bars)
- **Payment Progress**: PHP 50%, USD 100% (separate bars)

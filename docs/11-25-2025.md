## Todos

### Projects Module
- [ ] **Auto-populate Total Contract Cost**: When adding/updating projects, automatically copy "Total Project Cost" value to "Total Contract Cost" field (keep Total Contract Cost editable for manual adjustments)
- [ ] **Compact Projects Table**: Redesign table rows to be more compact and space-efficient while maintaining professional appearance (display more projects per page)

### Currency Selection UX
- [ ] **Improve Currency Selector UI**: Replace currency dropdown with a toggle or more intuitive control positioned beside amount inputs
  - Apply to: Invoice creation (single/bulk modes), Purchase Order creation, all forms with currency selection

### Activity Logging
- [ ] **Remove File Upload Logs**: Remove "file added" events from activity logs across all modules (too verbose)

### Purchase Orders
- [ ] **Fix Dialog Cancel Button**: In PO creation dialog, remove Cancel button or make it function as Close button

### Invoices - Bulk Mode
- [ ] **Set Range as Default Input Mode**: Change default from "Manual" to "Range" mode in bulk invoice creation
- [ ] **Fix Auto-increment Logic**: Fix invoice number generation in Manual mode with auto-increment
  - Current bug: Prefix "22" + increment from 1 generates "22001-22015"
  - Expected: Should generate "2201-2215"
  - Example: Prefix "INV" + increment from 100 should generate "INV100-INV115" (not "INV1000100")

### Invoices - Review Mode
- [ ] **Gmail-style Select All**: Implement Gmail-style toggle for "Select All" functionality
  - Make component reusable for Check Requisition creation/update workflows
  - Should handle: select all visible, select all pages, clear selection

### Check Requisitions
- [ ] **Make Purpose Field Resizable**: Change Purpose textarea from fixed height to resizable (allow vertical expansion)
